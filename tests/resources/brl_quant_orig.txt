There are some standard mathematical conversions that all
science students must memorize if they are to be
successful in science. Some of these are:
100° C = 212°F
1 ft. (or 1') = 12 in.(or 12")
100 cm = 1 m
1 lb (or 1 #) = 16 oz
100 cents = $1.00
5,280 ft. = 1
mi. 3 ft. = 1 yd.
1000 ml. = 1 l.
Students should also know that 100% can
be represented as 1.0, or 5% can be represented as 0.50.
Students should also be aware the the SI
system (Système International d'Unitès) is
the standard measurement system used in most
scientific works.
